# 🎵 Emotion-Based Music Player

## 📌 Overview
The **Emotion-Based Music Player** is an innovative system that integrates **human emotion recognition** with **technology**, revolutionizing personalized user experiences in **entertainment**. This project leverages **Raspberry Pi** and **OpenCV** to capture and analyze **facial expressions**, dynamically selecting **music tracks** based on the detected emotions.

Unlike traditional systems that rely on third-party APIs like **Spotify**, this solution operates as a **self-contained** and **privacy-focused** platform, ensuring full control over functionality and user data.

## 📸 How It Works
1. The **camera** captures the user’s **facial expression**.  
2. **OpenCV** and deep learning models analyze the emotion in real time.  
3. Based on the detected emotion (**happy, sad, angry, neutral, etc.**), a **music track** is selected.  
4. The **web application** allows users to interact and control the system.
